App with purpose to ease learning languages. 
Main idea is to help to learn single words, phrases, get its translation. Was decided to implement  deep_translator library as tranlation engine.
Treating of text is occuring with the help of re library.
I tried to envolve as much as possible conponents of Kivy 1.1.1 GUI.
To not overload attantion of user, I have tryed to make as much as possible design solution and stopped on idea of having main interface with 4 buttons, 
which might lead us to 4 screens: screen with lists of words, screen with possbility to add words from sentences, from articles and setting screen.
To treat text, to sort out separated words out of punctuation signs, digits, spaces here have been used regular expressions method.
